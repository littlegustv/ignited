I want the game to start off saying at the bottom 1940s London With 
Claire yelling at her mom and claire
 saying (Claire:I hate you) Then i want fire to come out of her hands 
and then the building needs to catch on fire I want them to be trapped in the house and have a bookshelf fall on clairs
 mom then clair /CHOICE/
 needs to try to help her by trying to pull 
her out or run out of the house but if she stays and trys to help say (Clair:whats going on whats wrong with me) 
then ciera says (Ciera:its ok you will understand some day now go you cant
save me if this house falls it will crush you)/CHOICE/ then i want whoevers playing the game have to find the 
front door while having things fall infront of claire and
while their trying to find their way out since theres no voices only dialogue have tears coming off her or something
like that when she gets out have the house collapse and fireman arive then i want a fireman to run up to her and
say(stranger: are you ok why arent you burnt then i want clair to say (Claire:i dont know I.....I...Im not......) 
then i want her to run 
into the woods when shes running in the woods let whoevers playing the game get to move her down a trail through the 
forest dont let them get off the trail then as they  move her  have her trip at a 
certain point in the
trail and then she needs to pass out and thats how i want it to end with her passed out so the screen should go black
